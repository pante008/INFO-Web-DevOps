      <h2>What makes Cat's Interesting</h2>
      <p>The Feline Physique: Cats share 95.6% of their DNA with tigers, explaining their mini-predator antics. Their ears, rotating 180 degrees with 30 muscles, are nature's surround sound system.</p>
      <p>The Feline Mind: Cats boast twice the neurons in their cerebral cortex as dogs, yet can't taste sweetness. They're the Einsteins of the animal kingdom with a peculiar dietary restriction.</p>
      <p>The Feline Lifestyle: These furry teenagers sleep 12-16 hours daily, mastering work-life balance. When awake, they're grooming experts who can leap six times their height.</p>
      <p>The Feline-Human Bond: Cats have a special "meow" just for humans, their secret love language. Owning one is like having a therapeutic, purring stress ball that occasionally redecorates your furniture.</p>
